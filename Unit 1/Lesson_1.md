Watch [here](https://youtu.be/bTKNTW4C83o).

Product Managers spend a lot of their time:

- Identifying/defining problems
- Creating a strategy
- Communicating
- Coordinating development
- Responding to fires

Which in turn, allows them to strategically answer important questions:

- What are we building?
- Who are we building this for?
- Why are we solving this problem? / Why are we building this specific solution?
- When are we building this?
